Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engeering is the process of designing, developing and testing software applications.
There are several importance of software engeneering which includes:
i. Software engeneering helps solve the real world problems by providing solutions through critical thinking.
ii. Through the development of various softwares, there has been increased global reach and connectivity to various users around the globe.
iii. Software engeneering has enabled the creation of softwares aimed at driving economic and societal progress overtime.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i. The emergence of structured programming in 1970s - the introduction of top-down approach to desigs diverting rom the earlier programming improving code efficeincy.
ii. Object oriented programming (OOP) in 1980s - developers created reusable codes due to the focus on objects.
III. Agile Technologies in 1990s - empasized on users feedback to deliver softwares faster and in-line with users needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. Discovery - involves developers identifying a gap, setting up objectives and goals of the project before hand.
ii. Design - diffrent equirements are outlined to fit the final project needs as per the customers specifications.
iii. Development - developers in teams follow programming guielines to code and complete smaller tasks which are later integrated.
iv. Testing and QA - developers test code quality and assurance either manually or automation
v. Release - after testing, the project's mistakes are rectified and launched.
vi. Maintenance - the developers tracts the application's perfomance and fix problems while perfoming upgrades.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is rigid and planned upfront while agile embraces flexibility is flexible and can be improved with time as the project continues.
waterfall intergration and testing is done at the end of the project while in agile, testing and intergration is done throughout the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writes codes and build software appliction.
Quality Assurance Engineer - performs software testing to identify bugs and ensure it meets quality standards.
Project manager -  oversees general process of software development by managing resources.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
These are crucial tools that enhances a developer's productivity by streamlining coding process, facilitating collaboration and tracking of codes efficiently.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i. Rapid Technological change - developers needs to regularly attend workshops and trainings to be updated.
ii. complex code debugging - various implementation of testings done to fix bugs.
iii. Security threats - developers need to intergrate security considerations in all stages of development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - doen during the first round of testing where the program's specific units are determined if they are fully functional.
intergration - developers cmbine all the specific units in a program and perfom testing as a group.
system testing - first level where the complete application is tested as a whole.
acceptance testing - this is the final phase done to determine the program's  readiness for release.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engeneering is where input is crafted carefully to generate desired output.
It helps in mitigating bias and minimize risk of generating inappropriate content.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
